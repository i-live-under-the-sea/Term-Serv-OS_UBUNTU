# Ubuntu-Online-Server
Have a host server. Can't use ubuntu on it? Well look no further, a online version of ubuntu.
Of course I don't work for ubuntu so I can't call this project ubuntu I just like the os
and I made a online version of it for servers.

I have a server with ubuntu on it but I can't access it. All I get is the cpanel menu
so I'm making a ubuntu online-copy for your server.
